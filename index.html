        <p>To strenghten educational support, we have employed the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)strategy. STEM is an educational reform that
            has been in the making for years. It may simply be defined as the integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into a new
            cross-disciplinary subject in schools. The study of STEM offers students the opportunity to make sense of the integrated world we live in rather
            than learning fragmented bits and pieces of knowledge and practices about it.</div>

        <h2>Why STEM Education?</h2><br>
        At the college and university levels, there are major concerns that the U.S. is loosing its technology and engineering leadership to other countries in
        the world. The Aerospace Industries Association of America reported in 2008 that the U.S. is currently experiencing a chronic decline in homegrown STEM
        talent, and is increasingly dependent on foreign scholars to fill the workforce and leadership voids Similarly in 2007, the total number of foreign
        citizens studying in the U.S. (including undergraduates) has passed the half-million mark. Nearly one-third of all graduate students enrolled in the
        U.S. universities now come from abroad (The National Academies, 2007). Our 21st century learners need to learn the skills needed to meet the demands of
        today's fast growing technology in today's classrooms by focusing on STEM education.
